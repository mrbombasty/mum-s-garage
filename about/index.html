        <p >We are working to overcome the self-constraints and pre-conceived ideas that prevent people from becoming extraordinary and making their mark on the world.</p>

        <p>Contrary to common beliefs, we know that entrepreneurialism is a way of thinking that is developed. It is not just something that you are born with, meaning that you either have it or you don’t.
        It starts with the drive to disrupt or bring about change in the world. This, coupled with a devotion to personal growth, is the catalyst for a successful entrepreneur.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, our schooling curriculum (and society in general) is not yet set up to develop  entrepreneurs, so most of us are not well equipped for this path. We fill this gap by teaching you how to grow your mind and develop the skills necessary to become an extraordinary entrepreneur. We do this by running transformative entrepreneurial programmes and events. </p>

      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
        <p>Mum’s Garage was born out its founder, Natalie Robinson’s, struggles with getting her own ideas off the ground. She realised that the lack of the RIGHT KIND of support for early stage entrepreneurs in New Zealand was limiting a large number of people (including herself) from progressing ideas and following dreams. She believed that the concept of entrepreneurship was unnecessary intimidating and the perceived barriers to entry for starting out in business were unnecessarily high.</p>
        <p>
        A grass-routes approach was needed, one without the hype, politics and the perception that entrepreneurship is only for the elite. A community focused on developing people, rather than just a business or an investment.</p>
        <p>
        So Natalie quit her corporate job and started Mum’s Garage…..in her mum’s garage. </p>
        <p>
        We think <a href="http://idealog.co.nz/tag/mums-garage">this</a> article sums up the story pretty nicely.</p>
